# foundation_nba_analytics_project

This repository is a preserved clone of the original `nba_analytics_project`, created to maintain a stable baseline before introducing further changes to the main project. Having two separate repositories ensures that the original work remains intact and accessible as a reference point at any time.

This version reflects work completed before relying heavily on AI. Core pipelines, cleaning logic, and analysis were written by hand to demonstrate original structure and reasoning. AI was used only for light suggestions.

## Purpose

- **Baseline reference**: Preserves the original state of the project so it can be compared against future iterations.
- **Safe experimentation**: Changes can be made freely in the main `nba_analytics_project` repository without risk of losing the foundational work captured here.
- **Version history**: Serves as a snapshot of the project at a specific point in development.
